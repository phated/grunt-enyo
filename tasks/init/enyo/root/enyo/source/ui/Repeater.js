/**
	_enyo.Repeater_ is a simple control for making lists of items.

	The components of a repeater are copied for each item created, and are
	wrapped	in a control that keeps the state of the item index.

	Example:

		{kind: "Repeater", count: 2, onSetupItem: "setImageSource", components: [
			{kind: "Image"}
		]}

		setImageSource: function(inSender, inEvent) {
			var index = inEvent.index;
			var item = inEvent.item;
			item.$.image.setSrc(this.imageSources[index]);
			return true;
		}

	Be sure to return true from your _onSetupItem_ handler to avoid having other
	event handlers further up the tree try to modify your item control.

	The repeater will always be rebuilt after a call to _setCount_, even if the
	count didn't change.  This behavior differs from that of most properties,
	for which no action happens when a set-value call doesn't modify the value.
	This is done to accomodate potential changes to the data model for the
	repeater, which may happen to have the same item count as before.
